Name: Noah Cress
Description: Website for a fictional cat/dog cafe
Details: Generally allows people to look into the cafe if they are interested to see what is offered in terms of drinks and animals.
Technologies: Html, css, and bootstrap were used.
Ideas: A calendar for events that would be going on, including directions to the cafe both on the home page and on the contact page, a fleshed out footer for each page that would include things like job opportunities/contact information/etc.
