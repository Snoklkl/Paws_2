            <h4>Anicetus</h4>
            <p>Anicetus has been a loving member of our family from the beginning! For all this time he's been our outgoing poster boy, making sure to greet everyone that comes in and getting along with all of those who give him the time of day. Anicetus absolutely loves getting any attention that he can get and can't wait to meet you! </p>
        </main>

        <!-- Info for second animal.-->

            <img class="Ours2" src="Images\2nd_animal.jpg" alt="Constantine" width=600px height=400px >
        </div>
        <main>
            <h4>Constantine</h4>
            <p>Don't be intimidated by this emperor! Constatnine might be shy at first, but that cold exterior is just waiting to melt away and give as much affection as possible! Anicetus's favorite pass time is running around in the grass and playing with his favorite frisbee. </p>
        </main>
        
        <!-- Info for third animal.-->
        <div class="image">

        </div>
        <main>
            <h4>Victor</h4>
            <p> Victor is quite the scaredy cat initially, but once he figures out that you just want to love him, he is all over you! Victor does require a delicate and patient demanor though, so don't expect to just rush into his love immediately. Being pushy may make him take longer to be willing to show you his more warm side. </p>
         </main>

         <!-- Info for fourth animal.-->
         <div class="image">
            <img class="Ours2" src="Images\4th_animal.jpg" alt="Sisinnius" width=600px height=400px >
         </div>

         <main>
            <h4>Sisinnius</h4>
            <p> Sisinnius is a high energy love bug that demands being played with as much as he can. When Sisinnius isn't prancing around, he's trying to find whatever lap he can to snuggle with. Just be careful, if you stay still too long he might decide to that you are his new bed!</p>
